 # Solid Principles 
 Benefits:
1. Better Code. 
2. Avoid Duplicate Code.
3. Easy to maintain and understand.
4. Reduce complexity.\

S (Single Responsibility Principal): A class should have only one reason to change. \
O (Open Close Principal) - Open for extension but closed for modification. \
L (Liskov's Substitution principle) - If Class B is subtype of Class A, then we should be able to replace object of A with B without breaking the behaviour of the program. \
I (Interface Segmented Principle) - Interfaces should be such, that client should not implement unnecessary methods that they do not need.\
D (Dependency Inversion Principle) -Class should depend on interfaces rather than concrete classes.

# Design Patterns
1. Strategy Pattern
2. Observer Pattern
